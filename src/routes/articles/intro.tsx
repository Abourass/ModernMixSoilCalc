          It's certainly been a long time since I've written something for here; please, forgive me if I'm a tad rusty.
          I've spent the last 5 or so years working as a web engineer, and while my love for plants hasn't waned, my time for writing about them certainly has.
          That being said, I'd wanted to revamp my site for a while now, and I figured I ought as well update the content while I'm at it.
          As I find more time, I want to add more features to the site, but for now, I'm at least happy to have a place to write again.
